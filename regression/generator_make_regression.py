Generating data with datasets.make_regression function

It creates a linear model y = w*X + b, then generates
'outputs' y and adds noise to X.

Now I understand.
the "features" are generated to be Gaussian and "centered" (around zero)
and having a standard deviation of 1, which means that they can be positive, 
negative and are potentially unlimited. This fake 'input' is put through
a linear model generated in a way that a standart deviation of 1 would 
transform into a 'target' of approximately 100. The 'bias' is the "b" term
of the linear model so it shifts the picture by the same number of units

What I don't understand is: why not define the coefficients of the linear
model? Why not let scale the output?
